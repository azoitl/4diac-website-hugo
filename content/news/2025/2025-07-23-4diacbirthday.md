  Today marks the 18th anniversary of Eclipse 4diac. On **July 23rd, 2007**, we presented 4diac for the very first time at a workshop at the *IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)*.

Throwback to INDIN 2007: The very first public presentation of 4diac.

What began as an academic prototype has, over the years, grown into a mature, open-source framework for distributed industrial automation based on IEC 61499.

## Then and Now

To highlight how far we've come, here’s a comparison of the very first 4diac IDE version and the current release:

Since that first presentation, 4diac has made significant progress:

- In 2007, we released the first version under the name 4diac.
- In 2010, 4diac FORTE became one of the first IEC 61499 runtimes ported to multiple embedded platforms.
- In 2015, the project officially joined the Eclipse Foundation as *Eclipse 4diac*.
- In 2021, we introduced the redesigned 4diac IDE with better usability and performance.
- This year, we will release version 3.0, featuring a modernized UI, largely extended [Structured Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_text) support, a much faster 4diac FORTE, and support for new APIs such as [open62541 1.4](https://www.open62541.org/).

Beyond technical development, our community has grown steadily. Contributors from academia, industry, and research have helped shape Eclipse 4diac into a reliable and versatile toolchain. The project has been used in teaching, prototyping, and even in production systems across the world.

Looking ahead, we’re continuing to push forward. This includes:
- Ongoing work on improving graphical editing and debugging capabilities
- A focus on interoperability with other technologies and standards
- Preparing for the *4 Days of Eclipse 4diac Winter School* in February 2026

A big thank you goes out to everyone who contributed over the years—whether through code, ideas, documentation, or testing. Your support made this journey possible.
