We enhanced the "Report Issue" button of the error indication dialog that appears when an unhandled exception occurs.
Clicking this button will open a new GitHub issue with the most relevant information already filled in:

  - Exception message
  - Stack trace

This helps us diagnose problems faster and reduces the effort for users when something goes wrong.

No more copy-pasting logs or trying to describe what happened—just click and report.

This is part of our ongoing efforts to improve stability and user experience. Try it out and let us know what you think!
